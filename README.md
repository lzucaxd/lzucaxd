# Luca-Alexandru Zamfira

**Machine Learning Engineer / AI Engineer (Biotech & Healthcare)**  
Biomedical imaging (microscopy/WSI), multimodal ML, and AI systems (GraphRAG, LLM pipelines)

I build **robust ML systems** for real biomedical data: variable-channel microscopy, pathology whole-slide images, and omics.
I also build **AI systems** that combine retrieval + structure (graphs) to improve faithfulness and efficiency.

## What I do

### 🔬 Biotech / Medical ML
- Channel-adaptive models for fluorescence microscopy (variable markers / missing channels)
- Whole-slide imaging (WSI) tumor detection pipelines (tiling → inference → heatmaps)
- Multimodal learning (imaging + molecular/proteomics signals)
- Evaluation, interpretability, and robustness under distribution shift

### ⚙️ ML Engineering
- Reproducible training/evaluation pipelines and data loaders
- Experiment tracking, scalable training, and model benchmarking
- Clean code + tooling (tests, scripts, docs) for research-to-production workflows

### 🤖 AI Systems (LLMs)
- GraphRAG: Neo4j + LlamaIndex for grounded QA over scientific literature
- Agentic pipelines with automated judging + refinement and efficiency modes
